How to install Ubuntu Mate:
1. follow the steps on youtube: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fZbJIe2oj8k
2. when you are about to type in command "sudo apt install ubuntu-mate-desktop", you
   need to connect your Pi to the internet. you can use the following procedure:
   https://medium.com/@jrcharney/connect-your-raspberry-pi-to-your-computer-via-ethernet-4564e1e68922
3. try to ping your Pi at the end of the procedure above. type "ping ubuntu.local"
4. next, when you are trying to type the command "sudo apt install ubuntu-mate-desktop" again,
   you will not be able to because the Pi is basically taken over by your laptop. This means
   you need to use PuTTY to use ssh.
5. to enable ssh on your Pi, type "ssh ubuntu@ubuntu.local". you will be asked for your password.
   yours is gladiatos.
6. by following the steps from https://raspberrypi4dummies.wordpress.com/2013/03/17/connect-to-the-raspberry-pi-via-ssh-putty/
   you will be able to connect your Pi. but if you type the Host name(or Ip Address) part, dont
   use the ipconfig /all of your raspberryPi to it. you need to ifconfig your raspberryPi
   to see your Pi's true ipV4 address. yours is 192.168.137.249
7. There are some warnings in the PuTTY. just click yes.
8. You have successfully ssh to your Pi. HOORAY!!!

How to ssh by PuTTY:
1. go to settings -> network & internet -> Ethernet -> Network and Sharing center
2. To let your pi connect to your laptop's internet: 
   click "wifi(name)" marked in blue -> properties -> sharing -> check "allow other network to connect..." -> ok -> close
3. Then: Ethernet marked in blue -> properties -> make sure the "Internet protocol Version 4"
   is checked list. 
4. to know wether your Pi is connected via ethernet, open windows command prompt -> type
   ping 'computer username/ip address from step 3'. if yes, it will show result.your Pi is "ubuntu"
5. to enable your Pi allow ssh, in the command prompt, type 
   "ssh 'computer username/ip address from step 3'.local" computer's name: ubuntu@ubuntu
6. it will show "ssh: connect to host ubuntu.local port 22: Connection timed out" if succeed.
7. Go to PuTTY, type in your computer username/ip address from step 3 then click ok.
8. you have succeed to remotely control your Pi.

How to connect VNCviewer to RaspberryPi for the first time:
1. connect your PC via ssh by PuTTY
   (type ssh ubuntu@ubuntu.local on cmd, then ifconfig to get your Pi's IP address. insert
    this to the PuTTY)
2. follow from the instruction from https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gsVhEEFM07I
   (your password for vncserver : connect)
3. after you have set the resolution, open VNCviewer, then type "IPV4addres:1" here, :1 is
   after you have run vncserver on your Pi via PuTTY. remember to insert your IPV4 address
   of your Pi. it may change. now your ip address is 192.168.1.6
   password: gladiatos
   username: ubuntu@ubuntu
4. finish. 

How to connect VNCviewer for the second time and so on:
1. connect via ssh by PuTTY
2. type vncserver. this will make your Pi open vncserver on its device.
3. you will be greet by "New 'X' desktop is ubuntu:1". this what i meant for :1 in step 3 above
4. Open VNCviewer, then type your desktop name. it should have already in there. just choose
   it (password: connect)
5. DONE.

to find you COM port, its in ubuntu's home -> file system -> dev -> serial -> by id / by path
or you can type ls /dev/ttyACM*
or you can type dmesg for fully connection
to read the data coming from serial port: cat /dev/ttyACM0 (https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/reading-serial-data-from-ttyacm0-4175650004/)
to write data to the serial port: echo -ne 'your data' > /dev/ttyACM0
to change the baud rate: stty 19200 < /dev/ttyACM0

Problem when installing ROS:
1. sudo apt-get update not working
	Solution: Change python version to 3.6, apparently python 3.7 just broke sudo apt-get update!
	to change python version, type: sudo update-alternatives --config python3
2. sudo rosdep init and rosdep update "error: command not found" when following the command from intorobotics.com website

setup your arduino ide to be able to use rosserial: http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino/Tutorials/Arduino%20IDE%20Setup#:~:text=Finishing%20Up-,Introduction,works%20over%20your%20Arduino%27s%20UART.
Problems:
	1. First, make your catkin workspace (<ws>) first as seen from the link above
	2. when catkin_make error could not find pythonInterpreter : solution is to remove the CmakeCache.txt in <ws>/build folder
	3. when catkin_make install error failed to open for writing (permission denied) type "sudo -s" first to become root user then
	   type catkin_make install. to go back to ubuntu@ubuntu, type "su ubuntu". or type "exit" until it exits

Teensy setup in Linux Ubuntu Mate:
follow : https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html
for teensy udev rules, see code at : https://forum.pjrc.com/threads/45691-Installer-for-udev-rules-in-Linux
	(run the "wget -O - http://www.nominal-animal.net/answers/install-teensy-rules | bash --" command, this will automatically do the trick) -> ini bisa donlod tapi copynya gabisa
for linux installer aarch64, to run executable file, type chmod +x myexecutables -> basically run ini buat bisa sampe akhir

Make your USB devices (Teensy, OpenCM9.04, Arduino, etc..) have its own name, not /dev/ttyACM* or /dev/ttyUSB*
-> https://medium.com/@darshankt/setting-up-the-udev-rules-for-connecting-multiple-external-devices-through-usb-in-linux-28c110cf9251
notes: In order for this to work, you must make all the parameter unique. if a parameter is the same, you can only use those parameter in 1 device. 
											      V check this parameter, same or no
	SUBSYSTEM==”tty”,SUBSYSTEMS==”usb”, ATTR{idProduct}==”0042", ATTR{idVendor}==”2341",ATTRS{serial}==”8573031393635151F1A0",MODE=”777", SYMLINK+=”steering”

How to flash ubuntu to odroid xu4
1. get some microSD card. recommended using minimum 32GB
2. format it to fat32 file system using AOMEI Partition Assistant
3. get your .img file from https://wiki.odroid.com/odroid-xu4/os_images/linux/ubuntu_4.14/ubuntu_4.14
4. choose MINIMAL, BARE OS so that it will use less space 
5. .img.xz file is .img file but it is compressed. simply decompressed it to get the .img file
6. use balena etcher to flash the .img file into the microSD card
7. when it finishes, eject the microSD card, then insert it to the microSD card slot on the xu4
8. FINISHED. HOORAY!

How to download openCV4 for odroid XU4:
1. go to https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/iot-opencv-4-1-on-odroid-xu4-8a14d395f191
2. follow the steps
3. the ‘cv2.cpython-36m-arm-linux-gnueabihf.so’ located at ‘opencv_package’ folder. rename it to cv2.so
   and then copy and paste it to /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages
4. when run your program, error PyUnicode from string, berarti itu ada hubungannya dengan salah
   masukin ke dist-packages atau site-packages atauga gak compatible cv2.so nya dengan versi python nya
5. kalo ada error "inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation", pake command "autopep8 -i my_file.py"
   donlod dulu tapi. masalah berkaitan dengan use space atau tab buat indent nya. gajelas juga sih ini
6. kalo ada error "unable to start pipeline", ada hubungannya dengan cv2.VideoCapture(). ganti jadi 
   cv2.VideoCapture(/dev/video0) yang tadinya cv2.VideoCapture(0)

Getting started with ROS and arduino:
1. follow https://maker.pro/arduino/tutorial/how-to-use-arduino-with-robot-operating-system-ros
2. if see an error import python error, then download using pip
3. to use rosserial, dont forget to Serial.begin() in the arduino, otherwise it will not connect
